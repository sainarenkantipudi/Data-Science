# Kaggle_IEEE_fraud

The following work was done for the Kaggle competition: [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection). Contestants were provided with four datasets, from Vesta Corporation:

- train_{transaction, identity}.csv - the training set
- test_{transaction, identity}.csv - the test set

and were asked to predict the probability of a card transaction being fraudulent. Submissions were evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability (of the test set) and the observed target.
